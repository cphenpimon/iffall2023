    <h2>Mango Sticky Rice</h2>
    <p>With coconut-cream-infused rice, glowing ripe mango slices, and a sweet
        coconut sauce, khao niaw mamuang, or Thai mango sticky rice, is easy to
        fall for. This recipe is inspired by the classic preparation (traditionally
        cooked in a bamboo steamer) but made differently. While some sticky rice
        recipes call for a strainer or cheesecloth-lined colander, this saucepan
        method eliminates the need for any special equipment, though we have
        provided instructions for using a rice cooker in case you happen to have
        one.</p>
        <p>Pay attention to the type of rice you're buying. Jasmine rice and other longgrain
        white rice varieties won't work here. Look for Thai sweet rice, also
        known as glutinous rice (don't worry, it's gluten-free), at East and
        Southeast Asian supermarkets or online. Soaking it in the water
        and coconut milk mixture overnight (or while you're at work) shortens the
        cooking time and imbues it with flavor. If it's your first time making sticky
        rice, know that when you see the grains of cooked rice clumping together,
        it's on purpose-that's the nature of the grain and what makes it so much
        fun to eat.</p>
        <p>While your rice cooks, brush up on how to cut a fresh mango. Spoon the
        fruit over the warm, sweet sticky rice and garnish with toasted sesame
        seeds and a squeeze of fresh lime.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>1 15-oz. can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Thai sweet rice, such as Three Rings</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. packed grated palm sugar, raw sugar, or brown
            sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/4 Tsp. kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 ripe Champagne or regular mangoes, cut into pieces, chilled</li>
        <li>Toasted white sesame seeds, black sesame seeds, finely grated lime
            zest, and lime wedges (for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Pour coconut milk into a large measuring cup or medium bowl. Fill empty
            can with cold water and add to coconut milk, whisking to combine. Add
            rice, cover, and let sit at room temperature 8-12 hours (coconut cream will
            rise to the top as rice soaks; whisk to combine before straining). Strain rice
            through a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl; reserve 3/4 cup soaking liquid.</p>
    
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p><strong>If cooking on a stovetop:</strong> Choose a large saucepan with a lid. Spread a
            clean kitchen towel on a work surface and place lid in the center, handle
            up. Tie 4 corners of towel together on top of lid (you've just turned the lid
            into a special airtight steam absorber that prevents the rice from getting
            gummy). Bring rice, sugar, salt, and reserved 3/4 cup soaking liquid to a
            simmer in saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve sugar.
            Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until liquid is absorbed, 15-25
            minutes-try not to lift the lid at all for the first 15 minutes. At the 15-
            minute mark, uncover and scrape a spoon against bottom of pan to make
            sure rice isn't sticking and all liquid is gone. If there's still liquid, replace
            lid and keep cooking.</p>
        <p><strong>If using a rice cooker:</strong> Combine rice, sugar, salt, and reserved 3/4 cup
            soaking liquid in machine's bowl and stir to dissolve sugar. Close lid and
            set cooker to "sweet rice" setting.</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Remove from heat and let sit, covered, 15 minutes. Using a fork, break up
            rice (it will have taken shape of bottom of pan) and separate into smaller
            clumps; rice will be very sticky so it will not separate into individual grains.</p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Divide warm rice among small bowls. Serve with mango alongside.
            Sprinkle with sesame seeds, then top with lime zest and a squeeze of lime
            juice.</p>
