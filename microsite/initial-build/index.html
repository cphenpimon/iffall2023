                <h3>What is Time Anyways?</h3>
                <p>Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, and into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.</p>

            <img class="home" src="images/discovery-home.jpg">
            <p>The discovery of time measurement has evolved through history. Early civilizations used sundials, while the hourglass became popular in the Middle Ages. The development of the modern watch in the 16th century marked a significant leap in timekeeping, enhancing accuracy and portability in our daily lives.</p>

            <p>Time is the heartbeat of society, orchestrating our daily routines and milestones. It structures our lives, from punctual meetings to annual celebrations, and fuels our ambitions, prompting us to set goals and deadlines. The collective agreement on time allows for coordination, collaboration, and progress. It also holds religious and philosophical significance, influencing our beliefs and inspiring deep philosophical questions about existence and reality.</p>
