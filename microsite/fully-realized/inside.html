                    <h3>The Calendar</h3>
                    <p>Artifacts from the Paleolithic suggest that the moon was used to reckon time as early as 6,000
                        years ago. Lunar calendars were among the first to appear, with years of either 12 or 13 lunar
                        months (either 354 or 384 days). Without intercalation to add days or months to some years,
                        seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months. Lunisolar calendars
                        have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year
                        (now known to be about 365.24 days) and a year of just twelve lunar months. The numbers twelve
                        and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this
                        relationship of months to years. Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica,
                        particularly in ancient Mayan civilization. These calendars were religiously and astronomically
                        based, with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month, plus five epagomenal days at the end of
                        the year.</p>

                    <h3>The Sundial</h3>
                    <img src="images/sundial.jpg" alt="Sundial">
                    <p>A sundial uses a gnomon to cast a shadow on a set of markings calibrated to the hour. The
                        position of the shadow marks the hour in local time. The idea to separate the day into smaller
                        parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials, which operated on a duodecimal system.
                        The importance of the number 12 is due to the number of lunar cycles in a year and the number of
                        stars used to count the passage of night.</p>

                    <h3>The Modern Clock</h3>
                    <p>Clocks can range from watches to more exotic varieties such as the Clock of the Long Now. They
                        can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical
                        power, and regulated by a variety of means such as a pendulum. Alarm clocks first appeared in
                        ancient Greece around 250 BC with a water clock that would set off a whistle. This idea was
                        later mechanized by Levi Hutchins and Seth E. Thomas. A chronometer is a portable timekeeper
                        that meets certain precision standards. Initially, the term was used to refer to the marine
                        chronometer, a timepiece used to determine longitude by means of celestial navigation, a
                        precision first achieved by John Harrison. More recently, the term has also been applied to the
                        chronometer watch, a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency COSC.</p>

                        <h3>Time as Linear for Abrahamic Religions</h3>
                        <p>In general, the Islamic and Judeo-Christian world-view regards time as linear and
                            directional, beginning with the act of creation by God. The traditional Christian view sees
                            time ending, teleologically, with the eschatological end of the present order of things, the
                            "end time". In the Old Testament book Ecclesiastes, traditionally ascribed to Solomon
                            (970–928 BC), time (as the Hebrew word עידן, זמן iddan (age, as in "Ice age") zĕman(time) is
                            often translated) was traditionally regarded as a medium for the passage of predestined
                            events. (Another word, زمان" זמן" zamān, meant time fit for an event, and is used as the
                            modern Arabic, Persian, and Hebrew equivalent to the English word "time".)</p>

                        <h3>Time in Greek Mythology</h3>
                        <p>The Greek language denotes two distinct principles, Chronos and Kairos. The former refers to
                            numeric, or chronological, time. The latter, literally "the right or opportune moment",
                            relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine time. In theology, Kairos is qualitative, as
                            opposed to quantitative. In Greek mythology, Chronos (ancient Greek: Χρόνος) is identified
                            as the Personification of Time. His name in Greek means "time" and is alternatively spelled
                            Chronus (Latin spelling) or Khronos. Chronos is usually portrayed as an old, wise man with a
                            long, gray beard, such as "Father Time". Some English words whose etymological root is
                            khronos/chronos include chronology, chronometer, chronic, anachronism, synchronize, and
                            chronicle.</p>

                        <img src="images/society-section.jpg" alt="Society-Section">
                        <p>In Philosophy, time was questioned throughout the centuries; what time is and if it is real
                            or not. Ancient Greek philosophers asked if time was linear or cyclical and if time was
                            endless or finite. These philosophers had different ways of explaining time; for instance,
                            ancient Indian philosophers had something called the Wheel of Time. It is believed that
                            there was repeating ages over the lifespan of the universe. This led to beliefs like cycles
                            of rebirth and reincarnation. The Greek philosophers believe that the universe was infinite,
                            and was an illusion to humans. Plato believed that time was made by the Creator at the same
                            instant as the heavens. He also says that time is a period of motion of the heavenly bodies.
                            Aristotle believed that time correlated to movement, that time did not exist on its own but
                            was relative to motion of objects. He also believed that time was related to the motion of
                            celestial bodies; the reason that humans can tell time was because of orbital periods and
                            therefore there was a duration on time.</p>

                    <h3>Scientific Definition</h3>
                    <p>The theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in Minkowski spacetime, a
                        mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space with a single dimension of time.
                        In this formalism, distances in space can be measured by how long light takes to travel that
                        distance, e.g., a light-year is a measure of distance, and a meter is now defined in terms of
                        how far light travels in a certain amount of time. Two events in Minkowski spacetime are
                        separated by an invariant interval, which can be either space-like, light-like, or time-like.
                        Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any frame of reference, there
                        must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation. Events that have
                        a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame
                        of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation. Different observers may calculate
                        different distances and different time intervals between two events, but the invariant interval
                        between the events is independent of the observer (and his or her velocity).</p>

                    <h3>Spacetime</h3>
                    <img src="images/spacetime.jpg" alt="Spacetime">
                    <p>Time has historically been closely related with space, the two together merging into spacetime in
                        Einstein's special relativity and general relativity. According to these theories, the concept
                        of time depends on the spatial reference frame of the observer, and the human perception, as
                        well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks, are different for observers in relative
                        motion. For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at (very nearly) the
                        speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel
                        because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock,
                        the crew's thought processes, and the functions of their bodies). </p>
